project contents:
1.  corrosion/expansion function of the binary image;  
2.  cross-complement basic operation function of the binary image;  
3.  Repeat the above two steps for the grayscale image;  
4.  Using the functions written in 1~3 to perform corrosion, expansion, cross-complementation, opening and closing operations, boundary extraction, morphological gradient analysis, etc. on binary images and grayscale images, respectively.
